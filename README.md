# airbnb-clone-project

## Project Overview

This project is designed to help you improve your skills in modern software development.  
By working on this project, you will learn how to:

- Work effectively with a team using **GitHub**.
- Understand **backend architecture** and **database design** better.
- Add **security features** when building APIs.
- Create and manage **CI/CD pipelines** for faster and smoother deployments.
- Plan and **document software projects** in a professional way.

This will enable us learn and understand software development lifecycles practices, security,
CI/CD and database design ath the end of the program.

## Tech Stack
we will be using stack like **Django**, **MySQL** and **GraphQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **Celery**, **Redis**, **Docker**, **CI/CD Pipelines**
